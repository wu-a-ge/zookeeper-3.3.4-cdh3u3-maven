    ZOOKEEPER-1084. Hard-coding a well-known location for configuration directory gives less flexibility for packaging Zookeeper configurations

    ZOOKEEPER-1030. higher default for maxClientCnxns
    
    The default for maxClientCnxns is 10, which is too low for many
    applications. For example, HBase users often run MR jobs where each
    task needs to use ZooKeeper to talk to HBase. This means that each
    slot on the tasktracker will have at least one ZK connection. With
    today's beefy machines, that's easily 20+ connections per node. I
    would suggest bumping the default to 60, which will still protect
    against runaway nodes (eg a leak in a tight loop) but won't impact MR
    jobs that need to talk to ZK.

    ZOOKEEPER-980. allow configuration parameters for log4j.properties
    
        Description: log4j.properties can contain properties that may be overridden using system properties. Hadoop's bin/hadoop is doing this already, I will be replicating in ZK's config.
